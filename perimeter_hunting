1.denied inbound traffic: conn.log, http.log, rdp.log, ssh.log, ftp.log
  why is this traffic being denied?
  where is the ip from?
  is the ip known to be malicious?
  what ports are involved? what services run on these ports?
  protocols?
  does the ip go after more than one port?
  
conn.log:
<- all denied connections -> 
select * from conn where conn_state = "REJ"

<- unique ips w/ count of denied connections -> 
select distinct(id_orig_h) as SourceIP, distinct(id_orig_p) as Port, count(id_orig_h) as CountOf from conn where conn_state = "REJ" group by id_orig_h

select * from conn where local_orig = true
select * from conn where local_orig = true and resp_country_code <> "US"

ssh.log:
<- all denied connections ->
select * from ssh where auth_success = false

<- unique ips w/ count of failed ssh attemps ->
select distinct(id_orig_h) as Source, count(id_orig_h) as CountOf from ssh where auth_success = false group by id_orig_h

http.log:
<- all status 400 connections w/ count ->
select distinct(id_orig_h) as Host, id_resp_h as Server, count(id_orig_h) as CountOf from http where status_code like "%400%" group by id_orig_h

select * from http where id_resp_p = 80
select * from http where id_resp_p = 443
select id_orig_h, referrer, uri, user_agent from http
select distinct(user_agent) from http
select distinct(host) from http
select distinct(uri) from http
select id_orig_h, response_body_len from http
